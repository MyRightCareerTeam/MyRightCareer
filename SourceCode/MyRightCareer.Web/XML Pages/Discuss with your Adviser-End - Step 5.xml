		  <bullet title="MyRightCareer Insights Documents:">

They should have taken all of their findings in this exercise and placed them in the appropriate document â€“ Be Your Best, Meaning/Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. They will form the foundation for the identification of your Right Opportunity in the Capstone Project.
