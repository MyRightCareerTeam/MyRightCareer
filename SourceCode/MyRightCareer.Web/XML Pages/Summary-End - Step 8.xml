	  <bullet title="Begin at the End:">
	    This is a chance to think beyond doing homework and going to class. A chance to think about a new world – the world beyond 17 years in school. It is a chance to fast forward to Age 30 and skip the rest of your 20′s. Don’t worry about how you got there. Bring in all the “Whole Person” parameters that are important to you. See your self at your 30th birthday party.

	  <bullet title="Work Backwards:">
	    This is a chance to do a little reality test of your Age 30 Vision. Work backwards to Age 22 and you will have seen what milestones you need to meet to reach your Age 30 Vision.
	  </bullet>
	  <bullet title="How will it really unfold?">
	    In reality things will unfold for you in ways that different than you put down on paper in this exercise. You will take your first step and either reach your Intermediate End Result #1 or not. You will certainly reach age 22. At Intermediate End Result #1 you will then decide the right next step. 
	  </bullet>
	  <p>
	    You can repeat this process at that time. You may not have the same Vision of your life at Age 30. You can work backwards once again from your new Age 30 Vision. But at some point opportunities may present themselves, or you will create them, that you never could have imagined. You will then make a decision if you should take advantage of those opportunities and your path will take a course that is very hard to predict right now.
